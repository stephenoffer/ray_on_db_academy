    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a \"just the facts\" introduction to [Ray](https://ray.io), the system for scaling your Python and ML applications from a laptop to a cluster. Here, we start with a hands on exploration of the core Ray API for distributed work loads:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ray _tasks_: Distributed execution of _stateless_ Python functions.\n",
    "* Ray _actors_: Distributed execution of _stateful_ Python classes.\n",
    "* Ray _ObjectRef_: Distributed Object Store for storing Future ObjectRefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent lessons explore the origin and goals for Ray, the rest of the core [Ray](https://ray.io) API ([documentation](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package-ref.html)), working with Ray clusters using the `ray` command-line interface (CLI), Ray replacement versions of several popular multiprocessing APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick among those lessons according to your interests. "
