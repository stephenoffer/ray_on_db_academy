    "[Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html), formerly known as **Ray SGD**, is a lightweight library for distributed deep learning, allowing you to scale up and speed up training for your deep learning models. Currently, Ray Train is available as beta (or experimental) in Ray 1.9 release, offering the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Scale to multi-GPU and multi-node training with 0 code changes\n",
    "\n",
    " * Runs seamlessly on any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, or on-prem)\n",
    "\n",
    " * Supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Horovod \n",
    "\n",
    " * Distributed data loading and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    " * Built-in loggers for TensorBoard and MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "See the instructions in the [README](../README.md) for setting up your environment to use this tutorial.\n",
